# 11056-project2
## Reflection
The goal for this project was to create a experimental responsive website using a Static Web Generator. For my sitie I was using eleventy static web genrator to create my site which the content for it was gonna be my portflio. For me creating a website using a static web generator had its pro and con but in end I think I was able to make a basic webpage for this project.

The main process of creating the site felt the same and gave the freedom of creating the website but once you had created most of the layouts it make creation process much more easier when adding new pages to the site. I didn't need to re-add any main conponets to each site (header, footer, linking, main format) and you can easier add the content to page through the main markdown file.

I feel the parts I did well in the project are making sure keeping a sepration between the main content of each page in the markdown and having all the html stuff in the layout and not having the content in the html layout allowing for easy changes to it through the markdown. I belive that I was able to do well on the main desgin / layout of website by spliting each section on the page and content show relates to the topic.

Areas that feel I could work on are
