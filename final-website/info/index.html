                <h1> VFX: Sk8-Bit (2024) </h1>
                <p>'SK8-Bit' was created as part of the Emerging Technologies Studio in the Master of Animation and Visualisation degree at the UTS Animal Logic Academy. 
                    The 2024 cohort worked in a simulated professional studio environment over a 10-week period to create a VFX film integrating live-action plates with 3D
                    assets across specialised departments. My role in this project was as a Layout / Matchmove Artist, where our task was to track the raw footage and align
                    the LIDAR data with the plates to enable departments to integrate their assets into the scene.

                    <h1>Camera Recration: Skyfall </h1>
                    <p>
                        During my time at UTS Animal Logic Academy, we were tasked with recreating a 15-second sequence from a film to strengthen our critical eye for cinematography
                        and develop our previs animation workflow. The goal was to better understand focal lengths, framing choices, and how each shot contributes to storytelling.
                        I chose the action-heavy train sequence from Skyfall, which features multiple fast-paced camera cuts in a short amout of time. This exercise helped me gain valuable insight into action
                        cinematography and improved my camera work and timing in previs animation.

                    <h1> Animation: Fool's Gold (Coming Soon) </h1>
                    <p>'Fool's Gold' was created as the main collaborative project in the Master of Animation and Visualisation degree at the UTS Animal Logic Academy.
                        The 2024 cohort worked in a simulated professional studio environment over the course of a year to produce a fantasy genre animated film, developed across 
                        specialised departments. My role in this project was as a Previs & Layout Artist, here I contributed both to the early and final stages of production.
                        As part of the Previs and Layout department, I was involved from the very beginning of production, translating the animatic and storyboards into 3D previs
                        to establish the visual foundation and camera framing of the story. I also contributed at the final stage of production by refining cinematography,
                        adjusting camera, and enhancing shots with handheld and camera shake movements to bring immersion and energy to the film.  </p>
                    <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Two goblin thieves stumble upon an ancient temple overflowing with treasure.
                        Blinded by greed, they raid the temple for all its gold, only to awaken a monstrous guardian and trigger a chaotic, treacherous chase. 
                        Will they escape with their lives, or become part of the treasure hoard forever?
