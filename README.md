# 11056-project2
## Reflection
The goal of this project was to create an experimental responsive website using a Static Web Generator. For my site, I was using eleventy static web generators to create my site and the content for it was gonna be my portfolio. For me creating a website using a static web generator had its pros and cons but in end, I think I was able to make a basic webpage for this project.

I started the project by first figuring out how to use eleventy and the basic flow of how the software works. While creating this site I watch a few youtube videos and read a few articles on creating a site with eleventy, Watching these videos help me in the production of my website and allow me to understand more about creating a site with eleventy static web generator. One of the more helpful videos was 'Jaydan Urwin's' eleventy crash course video. These videos were able to tell me more how to use the static web generator.

Once I knew how eleventy works, I worked on creating the base layout by adding a header Html for all the content in the header like the navbar and logo and I add the content for the footer. Once all the main content for the base layout was done I went on to create the layout for the body for each page and add content through the markdown. during this process, I added CSS to make the page look more pleasing.

The main process of creating the site felt the same and gave the freedom of creating an website but once you had created most of the layouts it made the creation process slightly easier when adding new pages to the site. I didn't need to re-add any of the main components to each site (header, footer, linking, main format) and you can easier add the content to the page through the main markdown file.

I feel the parts I did well in the project are making sure to keep a separation between the main content of each page in the markdown and having all the Html stuff in the layouts and making sure not to have too much content in the main Html layout allowing for easy chaning of content all in the markdown. I believe that I was able to do well on the main design/layout of the website by creating different section for each content on the page.

Parts that I struggled with throughout this assessment was the linking of stuff from the layout to the markdown file. for example, I had trouble figuring out how to continue adding content underneath the gallery (on the homepage), but I was able to figure out one way to do it in the end. A lot of my problem occurs with the linking of files between each other. 

even though I had trouble with some areas I believe I was able to create a site using the eleventy static site generator even with doing things slightly different to others. In the end, I was able to create a reasonable home page using the tools I was given.
